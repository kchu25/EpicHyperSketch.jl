Add large-scale convolution test and fix GPU kernel bugs

Created comprehensive test coverage for ConvolutionFeature with 750 sequences
and fixed critical GPU kernel bugs affecting motif extraction.

New Features:
- test/test_large_example_convolution.jl: Large-scale convolution test with
  ground-truth motifs and validation for both CPU and GPU backends
- test/CONVOLUTION_TEST_README.md: Detailed documentation explaining test
  design, position constraints, and probabilistic behavior

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed GPU kernel scope bug: Variable 'comb_num' used outside loop in both
  obtain_motifs_conv! and obtain_motifs_ordinary! kernels. Introduced
  last_comb_num variable to properly track combination index.
- Fixed GPU thread config: Extract integer from threads_1d tuple before
  using in cld() for kernel launch calculations.
- Fixed GPU array transfer: Convert where_exceeds_vec to CuArray before
  passing to GPU kernels to avoid non-bitstype argument error.

Test Results:
- All 18 tests passing on both CPU and GPU
- Complete coverage for both OrdinaryFeature and ConvolutionFeature cases
- Validates proper handling of batch processing, filter spacing, and
  probabilistic Count-Min Sketch behavior

Files Changed:
- src/count_gpu.jl
- src/count_gpu_extract.jl
- test/test_large_example_convolution.jl (new)
- test/CONVOLUTION_TEST_README.md (new)
- test/runtests.jl
