# Bug Fix: Partitioned Processing Extraction Issue

## Problem Identified

After implementing the memory-efficient partitioned processing, **no motifs were being extracted** (0 configurations from all partitions).

## Root Cause

The issue was in how we were calling the processing pipeline:

### Original (Broken) Approach
```julia
# In obtain_enriched_configurations_partitioned:
count!(pr, config)              # Process all partitions
make_selection!(pr, config)     # Process all partitions again
motifs = obtain_enriched_configurations(pr, config)  # Process all partitions AGAIN
```

**Each function created NEW Records for each partition:**

1. `count!(pr, config)`:
   - For partition 1: Create Record → Count → GC frees it
   - For partition 2: Create Record → Count → GC frees it
   - etc.

2. `make_selection!(pr, config)`:
   - For partition 1: Create **NEW** Record → Select → GC frees it
   - For partition 2: Create **NEW** Record → Select → GC frees it
   - etc.

3. `obtain_enriched_configurations(pr, config)`:
   - For partition 1: Create **NEW** Record → Extract → **No selections!** → 0 results
   - For partition 2: Create **NEW** Record → Extract → **No selections!** → 0 results
   - etc.

**Problem**: The `selectedCombs` arrays are stored **in the Record**, not in the shared sketch!

- When `make_selection!` marks combinations as selected, it modifies `record.selectedCombs`
- When we recreate the Record for extraction, `selectedCombs` is freshly initialized (all `false`)
- Result: Extraction finds no selected combinations → 0 motifs extracted

## Solution

Process each partition **completely** before moving to the next:

```julia
# In obtain_enriched_configurations_partitioned:
for each partition:
    record = _create_record_for_partition(partition, pr, i)
    count!(record, config)           # Count into shared sketch
    make_selection!(record, config)   # Mark selections in THIS record's selectedCombs  
    df = extract_from(record, config) # Use THIS record's selectedCombs
    # Record with its selectedCombs goes out of scope
```

Now the same Record object is used for count → select → extract, preserving the selection state!

## Code Changes

### Removed These Functions
```julia
# These recreated Records and lost selection state
function count!(pr::PartitionedRecord, config::HyperSketchConfig)
function make_selection!(pr::PartitionedRecord, config::HyperSketchConfig)
function obtain_enriched_configurations(pr::PartitionedRecord, config::HyperSketchConfig)
```

### Updated Main Entry Point
```julia
function obtain_enriched_configurations_partitioned(...)
    # Create partitioned record
    pr = create_partitioned_record(...)
    
    # Process each partition completely
    dfs = Vector{DataFrame}(undef, length(pr.partitions))
    
    for (i, (partition, range)) in enumerate(zip(pr.partitions, pr.partition_ranges))
        # Create Record ONCE for this partition
        record = _create_record_for_partition(partition, pr, i)
        
        # Use the SAME record for all three steps
        count!(record, config)           # Counts accumulate in shared sketch
        make_selection!(record, config)   # Selections stored in record.selectedCombs
        dfs[i] = _obtain_enriched_configurations_(record, config)  # Uses record.selectedCombs
        
        # Now record (with its selections) goes out of scope
    end
    
    # Combine all DataFrames
    return vcat(dfs...)
end
```

## Test Results

After the fix:
```
Partition 1: 217 configurations ✓
Partition 2: 718 configurations ✓  
Partition 3: 1590 configurations ✓
Total: 2525 configurations ✓
```

All tests now pass!

## Key Lesson

When implementing sequential processing to save memory, **ensure stateful data is preserved**:

- ✅ `shared_cms`: Stored in PartitionedRecord, shared across all Records → Works correctly
- ❌ `selectedCombs`: Stored in each Record, recreated when Record is recreated → Was broken
- ✅ **Solution**: Process each partition completely with one Record instance

## Memory Efficiency Still Maintained

The fix doesn't compromise memory efficiency:
- Still only one Record in memory at a time
- Each Record is GC'd after its partition is fully processed
- Peak memory = max(single partition) + shared sketch

The key is that each partition is processed **completely** before the next, not that we separate the count/select/extract phases across all partitions.

## Documentation Updated

- `PARTITIONING_REFACTOR.md`: Updated to show per-partition pipeline
- `src/partition.jl`: Added comments explaining the critical sequencing
- Removed old separate methods to avoid confusion
